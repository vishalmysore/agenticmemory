🔎 What Themes and Focuses Emerge

Agent-centered architectures: Many of his articles propose moving beyond monolithic AI to multi-agent, distributed, mesh-style systems.

Bridging AI with traditional engineering: He often works on making AI integration feasible for existing codebases — e.g. using Java microservices + AI, or retrofitting microservices with agentic capabilities — not just building new AI-native systems from scratch.

Knowledge graphs + AI: A strong recurring theme — using graph databases/knowledge graphs as a semantic, explainable backbone for AI systems; combining KGs with RAG and agent workflows to improve reliability, compliance, and reasoning.

Practical, production-ready thinking: Rather than academic theory, his writing emphasizes realistic, deployable systems — microservices, REST/APIs, agent protocols, and maintainable architectures.

Clarity and caution about “agentic AI hype”: In pieces like the “20-Question BS Detector,” he encourages critical thinking about what qualifies as a true AI agent vs. mere automation.
