All payments are non-refundable except as explicitly provided in Section 8 (Termination) of this Agreement. The Client is responsible for all bank fees, wire transfer charges, and any taxes applicable to the services provided under this Agreement.

SECTION 4: CONFIDENTIALITY
Both parties acknowledge that during the term of this Agreement, they may have access to confidential and proprietary information belonging to the other party, including but not limited to trade secrets, business strategies, customer lists, technical specifications, source code, and financial information ("Confidential Information"). Each party agrees to: (a) maintain the confidentiality of all Confidential Information received from the other party; (b) use such Confidential Information solely for the purposes of performing its obligations under this Agreement; (c) not disclose Confidential Information to any third party without prior written consent; and (d) implement reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access or disclosure. These confidentiality obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement and continue for a period of five (5) years thereafter. Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) is publicly available through no breach of this Agreement; (ii) was rightfully in the receiving party's possession prior to disclosure; or (iii) is required to be disclosed by law or court order, provided that the disclosing party gives reasonable notice to allow the other party to seek protective measures.

SECTION 5: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
All intellectual property developed by the Contractor in the course of providing services under this Agreement, including software code, documentation, designs, and related materials ("Work Product"), shall become the exclusive property of the Client upon receipt of full payment for such Work Product. The Contractor hereby assigns all rights, title, and interest in the Work Product to the Client, including all copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and other proprietary rights. The Contractor retains ownership of any pre-existing intellectual property, tools, libraries, or frameworks that were developed prior to this Agreement ("Background IP").

This limitation of liability shall not apply to: (a) damages caused by willful misconduct or gross negligence; (b) breaches of confidentiality obligations; or (c) intellectual property indemnification claims. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply in all cases.

Either party may terminate this Agreement: (a) for cause, upon 30 days' written notice if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within the notice period; or (b) for convenience, upon 60 days' written notice without cause, subject to payment for services performed up to the termination date. Upon termination, the Client shall pay the Contractor for all services performed and expenses incurred up to the effective date of termination, prorated according to the percentage of work completed. The Contractor shall deliver all Work Product completed as of the termination date, and the Client shall return or destroy all Confidential Information belonging to the Contractor.

The Contractor shall have sole control over the manner and means of performing the services, subject to meeting the specifications and requirements set forth in this Agreement. The Contractor is responsible for all taxes, insurance, benefits, and other obligations related to its personnel.

The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding, and judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
